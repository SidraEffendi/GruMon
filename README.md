GruMon is an app inspired by the paper 'GruMon: fast and accurate group monitoring for heterogeneous urban spaces'. 
This app uses google Maps API to access to user location and then wifi-fingerprinting allows to locate the person 
inside a building. There is a prompt to enter the floor number and all the infomation is saved to be pushed to server.
